# TROPI - A React, GraphQL, Next and Apollo example Shop
The application implements a basic shop, where a user can create an account and make an order by adding items to his cart. Also is possible to manage items (creating, deleting and updating them) depending on users permissions. 

## Structure
### Interface Client Side
For building the interface in React.js, it is used the framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for things as rendering and routing. In styling it is used [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/). As the application uses Apollo Client, also it uses [React-Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo) for interfacing with it. For image hosting the service used is [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). Also it used a cool progress bar, [NProgress](https://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/). Finally, in the testing area it used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/).
